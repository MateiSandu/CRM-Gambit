<b>DISCLAIMER: This isn’t exactly a masterclass in Salesforce wizardry. I’m just having a bit of fun combining chess with Salesforce and playing around with JavaScript to create HTML elements, so definetely not the usual approach. The method might not be the pinnacle of elegance or efficiency, but hey, where’s the fun without a bit of experimentation? 

Huge shoutout to my trusty sidekick, ChatGPT!</b>

Here’s what’s on my chess-to-do list:
<i>
* Ensure Only Legal Moves - This involves a whole lot more, like indicators for whose turn it is, highlighting legal moves on click, and not allowing illegal moves. (Yep, that's done—well, mostly!)

* Style Improvements - Still in the "done-ish" category, because why stop at decent when you can aim for "almost stylish"?

* Fix the Disappearing Piece Trick - That moment when you click and hold a piece, and it just vanishes. Kind of like a magic trick gone wrong.

* Undo-Redo Button - Because we all make mistakes, and being able to undo your epic blunders is a true lifesaver.

* Move History - Keep track of every move so you can analyze how you ended up in that checkmate mess.

* Game Over Messaging - Display a grand proclamation of victory or defeat, because chess isn’t just about winning; it’s about the drama!  

* Create a Game Object - So you can save and load games like a pro. Because who wants to lose their hard-fought progress?

* Stockfish Integration - Because nobody beats Stockfish, it will play 1 calculated move and 1 random move.

* Analytics - Dive deep into the numbers with Salesforce reports and dashboards. Because analyzing is the new winning.

* Game Analysis - Break down every move like a sports commentator analyzing the big game.

* Gamification - Achievements and badges are coming! Earn your bragging rights as you crush your chess goals.

* Maybe Chatter? - Who knows? A bit of chess banter in Chatter might just be the next big thing.

* Time Control - Because sometimes a chess game needs a bit of pressure, and no, it's not just about taking your time.

* Captured and Lost Pieces Display - So you can reminisce about the pieces you’ve captured and those you’ve lost, like a chess museum.

* Mobile View Enhancements - Making sure your chess skills look as good on mobile as they do on desktop.*
