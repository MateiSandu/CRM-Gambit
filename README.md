<b>DISCLAIMER: This is not intended to represent all the best practices for Salesforce. I was experimenting with combining chess and Salesforce for fun, and I was also exploring how to create HTML elements directly from JavaScript. As a result, the approach might not be the most effective, nor very clean!!</b>

(Couldn't have done it without the help of my dear friend chatGPT)

High hopes but let's see ;)

TODO
* Allow only legal moves - this comes with a lot more things to be done, such as an indicator to whose turn it is, seeing what moves are legal upon click, removing the move if it's not legal, etc    ---DONE
* Style improvement  ---DONE(ish)
* Fix the issue where the the piece disappears upon clicking and holding it
* Undo-redo last move button
* Move history
* Message to show when game is over - saying who won 
* Bot creation - unsure about how it will be done yet - currently thinking about Lichess API 


* I was thinking about creating 4 Salesforce objects: 
1. Game object
2. Move object
3. Player object
4. Position object
(This would allow me to save and load games hopefully)


* Create Analytics - (reports/dashboards)
* Game analysis
* Implement Gamification - once I have some bots, I can do Achievments and Badges
* Maybe Chatter?
* Time control
* See what pieces you've captured and what pieces you lost
* See if mobile view can get an improvement
