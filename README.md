High hopes but let's see ;)

(Couldn't have done it without the help of my dear friend chatGPT)

TODO
* Allow only legal moves - this comes with a lot more things to be done, such as an indicator to whose turn it is, seeing what moves are legal upon click, removing the move if it's not legal, etc    ---DONE
* Fix the issue where the the piece disappears upon clicking it
* Bot creation - unsure about how it will be done yet - currently thinking about Lichess API 
* Style improvement


FUTURE
* Game analysis
* can einstein be in any way leveraged for this?
* PGN and FEN readers
